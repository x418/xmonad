-- @closed@ event.  A window's @identifier@ event provides a genuinely unique
-- string for anything that needs to outlive the object -- which is also why
-- river does not export xmonad's state-file machinery: an id serialised now
-- means nothing to the process that reads it back.

-- | What the river layer surfaces to @handleEventHook@ and to layouts.
--
-- Deliberately small.  Most of what an X11 window manager learns from raw
-- events, river delivers as accumulated state on 'RiverWindow' instead, so
-- there is nothing to translate.
--
-- 'DestroyWindowEvent' keeps its X11 spelling because @XMonad.Layout@
-- matches on it by name to release a layout's per-window state, and
-- @river_window_v1.closed@ means exactly what the X11 event meant.  The rest
-- are named for what river actually reports.
data Event
  = DestroyWindowEvent { ev_window :: !Window }

    -- away, or one of them moved or changed size.

    -- X11 made a config work this out for itself, from @ConfigureNotify@ on
    -- the root window versus @RRScreenChangeNotify@, and clear the burst of
    -- duplicates Xorg emitted with them.  river reports each output's position
    -- and dimensions directly, so the window manager can just compare the
    -- result -- this is sent only when the rectangles genuinely differ from
    -- what the 'WindowSet' already had.  See "XMonad.Hooks.Rescreen".
  | SessionLocked
  | SessionUnlocked
  | KeyPressed { ev_state :: !KeyMask, ev_keysym :: !KeySym }
    -- ^ A key captured by "XMonad.River.Keyboard".
    --
    -- Not something river volunteers: the window manager only learns about
    -- keys it has created a binding for, so this reaches a config only while
    -- something -- a prompt, a submap -- is holding a grab.  Ordinary
    -- keybindings never arrive this way; they run their action directly.
  | TimerFired !Int
    -- ^ A timer started with @XMonad.Util.Timer.startTimer@ has expired.
    --
    -- Not something the compositor sends: the window manager posts it to
    -- itself when a timer thread reports in.  X11 did the same thing by
    -- sending a client message to the root window, which needed an interned
    -- atom and a round trip through the server; here it is a constructor.
  | WindowFullscreenChanged { ev_window :: !Window, ev_fullscreen :: !Bool }
    -- ^ @river_window_v1.fullscreen_requested@ or @exit_fullscreen_requested@:
    -- a client asked to become fullscreen, or to stop being.
    --
    -- It is a request, not a fact.  River leaves the decision to the window
    -- manager: the flag behind
    -- 'XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers.isFullscreen' is updated before this is
    -- sent, so a hook can read the state it is being told about, but nothing
    -- has resized anything.  Acting on it is what
    -- "XMonad.Layout.Fullscreen" is for.
    --
    -- Named for what happened rather than for the two protocol events,
    -- because a handler almost always wants both and the flag is the
    -- difference between them.  X11 delivered the same thing as a
    -- @_NET_WM_STATE@ client message carrying add\/remove\/toggle, and the
    -- toggle case is why upstream's handler has to read the current state
    -- before it can act; here the answer is in the event.
  | SurfaceClicked { ev_window :: !Window, ev_x :: !Position, ev_y :: !Position }
    -- ^ @river_seat_v1.shell_surface_interaction@: a surface the window
    -- manager drew was pressed, rather than merely hovered over.
    --
    -- This is the port of X11's @ButtonPress@ on a decoration window, and it
    -- is a separate constructor because a decoration is not a
    -- @river_window_v1@ -- it is a @river_shell_surface_v1@ this process
    -- created, so river reports a click on it separately from a click on a
    -- client's window.  The id here is that shell surface, which is what
    -- @XMonad.Util.XUtils.createNewWindow@ returned and therefore the same
    -- 'Window' a decoration is known by in "XMonad.Layout.Decoration".
    --
    -- The position is river's global coordinate space, matching X11's
    -- @ev_x_root@ \/ @ev_y_root@ rather than its window-relative @ev_x@ \/
    -- @ev_y@; a caller wanting the offset within the decoration subtracts the
    -- rectangle it put there.  It is the pointer position as of this manage
    -- sequence, which is the position at the moment of the press: river sends
    -- @shell_surface_interaction@ and any @pointer_position@ change before the
    -- @manage_start@ that delivers them, so the two cannot be out of step.
    --
    -- No button number, and no press\/release distinction.  River reports that
    -- an interaction happened and deliberately not what caused it -- it may
    -- have been touch or a tablet tool -- so a hook that switched on
    -- @button1@ has nothing to switch on.

-- narrower: 'river_window_v1.dimensions_hint' carries a minimum and a maximum
-- and nothing else.
--
-- The three fields that are always 'Nothing' are not oversights.  Wayland has
-- no resize increments, no aspect ratio hint and no base size; there is
-- nothing for them to be read from, on any compositor.  They are kept so that
-- the arithmetic -- which already does the right thing with an absent hint --
-- needs no river-specific variant, and so that a layout written against
-- xmonad's 'SizeHints' still typechecks.
--
-- X11's @sh_win_gravity@ is absent entirely: gravity describes how a window
-- moves when its parent resizes, and Wayland has neither the parent
-- relationship nor the concept.

-- Window attributes

-- | What X11 answered @XGetWindowAttributes@ with, restricted to the parts
-- river can answer for.
--
-- Same reasoning as 'SizeHints': keeping the X11 name and field names means a
-- module that only wants a window's geometry compiles unchanged, and there are
-- a lot of those.  The fields that are here are real answers.
--
-- The ones that are not here are the X11 server's own bookkeeping, and there
-- is no server: @wa_colormap@, @wa_visual@, @wa_depth@, @wa_backing_store@,
-- @wa_save_under@, @wa_your_event_mask@ and the rest describe how a window is
-- stored and drawn by X, which under Wayland is between the client and the
-- compositor and no business of the window manager's.  A module reaching for
-- one of those gets a compile error, which is the right answer: it is doing
-- X11 drawing, not window management.
--
-- One caveat on 'wa_x' and 'wa_y'.  X11 reported where the window /was/;
-- these report where the last layout run /put/ it, because river never says
-- where a window is -- the window manager is what decided.  For a window the
-- layout did not place, both are zero and 'wa_map_state' is 'waIsUnmapped'.
