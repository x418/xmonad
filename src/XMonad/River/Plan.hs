-- | What the window manager decided, as a value.
--
-- The manage and render sequences used to compute and transmit in one pass:
-- 'XMonad.River.WM.applyLayout' ran the layout and sent @propose_dimensions@
-- from inside the same @X@ action.  That works only while the thing computing
-- and the thing holding the connection are the same thread, and they are about
-- to stop being -- see @DESIGN.md@.  So the decision is separated from its
-- delivery: everything above computes a 'Plan', and one place below transmits
-- it.
--
-- The shape follows river's own.  Most of what a sequence sends is a /total
-- restatement/ -- river keeps no memory of rendering state, so every frame
-- states position, borders, stacking and visibility again from scratch -- and
-- a restatement is naturally a value that may be re-sent verbatim.  A few
-- requests are not restatements but one-shot effects, and re-sending one of
-- those is a bug rather than a no-op: @close@ twice kills a second window.
-- Hence 'Plan' and 'Op' rather than one list of things to do.
