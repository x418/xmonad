-- | The river window management state machine, driving an xmonad 'WindowSet'.
--
-- river splits state into two disjoint categories, and the split shapes this
-- module:
--
-- * __Window management state__ — dimensions, keyboard focus, keyboard
--   bindings — may only be modified during a /manage sequence/, between the
--   @manage_start@ event and the @manage_finish@ request.
-- * __Rendering state__ — position, stacking order, borders, hide\/show — may
--   be modified during either sequence, but is only applied at
--   @render_finish@.
--
-- So layout runs during the manage sequence (it must, to propose dimensions),
-- its results are stashed, and positions are applied during the following
-- render sequence.
--
-- Deciding and transmitting are separate. Everything in the 'X' monad computes
-- a "XMonad.River.Plan" and touches the connection not at all; 'transmitManage'
-- and 'transmitRender' take that value and send it, filtered against the
-- windows river still has. That split is what the thread split in @DESIGN.md@
-- is built on -- the thing that decides and the thing that owns the connection
-- are on their way to being different threads -- and it is worth keeping even
-- before then: a plan can be re-sent, so a sequence the window manager has
-- nothing new for is answered by restating the last one.
--
-- Bindings fire outside any sequence. Their actions are queued and run at the
-- start of the next manage sequence, which river is asked to schedule with
-- @manage_dirty@. This is the same deferral river's own reference window
-- manager uses.

-- | The chord that always works.
--
-- Two things in this window manager can make a session unusable by taking
-- something and not giving it back, and both have done so:
--
-- * a prompt is a layer surface holding an exclusive keyboard grab, so if its
--   thread stops answering, every keystroke goes somewhere nothing is reading;
-- * a submap disables every one of the config's bindings until it closes, so
--   one that never closes leaves a session with no shortcuts at all.
--
-- Each now has its own guard -- guaranteed teardown, and a deadline -- and
-- this is what remains when a guard is the thing that failed.  It is deliberately
-- not part of @keyActions@: it is registered separately, never recorded in
-- 'rtBindings', and therefore not among the bindings a submap disables.  A
-- config cannot rebind or remove it, which is the point; a break-glass key
-- that the broken thing can switch off is not one.
--
-- The chord is @Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Escape@, chosen to be one nothing else wants.
--
-- This works at all because of how river dispatches: @KeyboardGroup.processKey@
-- matches xkb bindings /before/ it consults keyboard focus, so a binding fires
-- even while a layer surface holds an exclusive grab.  Without that ordering
-- there would be no key that could rescue a wedged prompt, and the only way
-- out would be a TTY.

--
-- Inside the manage sequence that carries the key press which asked for it,
-- which is the whole reason this is the loop's work rather than the config's:
-- river holds every input event for the seat until the sequence finishes, so
-- arming here is atomic with the press.  Arming one sequence later would leave
-- an interval in which the globals are live and this is not, and the second
-- key of a chord would run the wrong thing.
--
-- Every one of the window manager's own bindings is disabled meanwhile.  river
-- leaves it to compositor policy which of several bindings matching one
-- physical key receives the press, so leaving the globals live alongside these
-- would make a prefix key that is also a captured key -- @M-m m@, say -- do
-- something undefined.
