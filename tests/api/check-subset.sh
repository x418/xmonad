# Assert that this fork's API is the intended subset of upstream xmonad's.
#
# Usage: tests/api/check-subset.sh
#
# Reads two checked-in goldens; builds nothing.  They come from different
# places, and that asymmetry is the point:
#
#   tests/api/river/     this fork, dumped from its own build
#                        stack build && GHC="stack exec -- ghc" tests/api/dump-api.sh tests/api/river
#
#   tests/api/upstream/  upstream xmonad, recorded from a real checkout
#                        tests/api/record-upstream-api.sh ../xmonad
#
# Upstream is a recording rather than a build because this package no longer
# carries upstream's sources -- there is one source tree and it is the river
# one.  The assertion those sources existed to support is what survives them:
# a config or an xmonad-contrib module written against upstream's API compiles
# here, because everything absent is absent on purpose and written down.
#
# Three assertions, each of which has caught something worth catching:
#
#   1. Every name upstream exports and this fork does not is justified in
#      unportable.txt -- and every name justified there is genuinely absent.
#      The second half matters as much as the first: a stale entry means the
#      file is describing a backend that no longer exists.
#
#   2. This fork's eight modules add *nothing* to xmonad's API.  Everything it
#      offers that upstream does not lives in XMonad.River, which this check
#      does not look at -- so a config importing XMonad sees exactly the names
#      upstream offers, minus the unportable ones, and never more.  A
#      river-specific name appearing in XMonad.Core is a failure whose fix is
#      to move it to XMonad.River.  The comparison is against the union of
#      upstream's own surface and its Graphics.X11 re-exports, so a name that
#      merely moves between those two files is not flagged.
#
#   3. This fork re-exports nothing from a Graphics.X11-shaped compat surface.
#      This is the positive form of the rule the whole backend is built on: it
#      does not imitate an X11 that is not there.
